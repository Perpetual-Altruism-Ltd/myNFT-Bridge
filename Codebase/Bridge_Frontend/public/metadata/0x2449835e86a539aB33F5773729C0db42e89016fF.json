{"name":"IOU of Quadratic Funding by Vitalik Buterin","description":"In December 2018, in their paper ‘Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds’ Vitalik Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, and E Glen Weyl put forward an innovative model called Quadratic Funding, which could form the basis of a new general purpose infrastructure for the funding of public goods. In principle the model incentivizes individuals to voluntarily contribute amounts that together signal to a government how much society as a whole values a public good, how much should be spent on it, and where that funding should be directed. Vitalik’s Cryptograph is his hand drawn representation of this groundbreaking Quadratic Funding formula.
