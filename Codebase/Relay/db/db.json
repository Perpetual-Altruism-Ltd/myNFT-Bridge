In December 2018, in their paper ‘Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds’ Vitalik Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, and E Glen Weyl put forward an innovative model called Quadratic Funding, which could form the basis of a new general purpose infrastructure for the funding of public goods.
